The current folder includes the following:

1. A code to reproduce the simulation using Leslie matrices in R ("Leslie_matrices_code.R"). In order to run this code, the user will need data from an initial generation of individuals with BMI and polygenic risk score por BMI (PRS). An example of such data is provided (see 2).

2. An example of an initial generation for running the code above. This example generation is drawn from couples in the 2006 wave in the Health & Retirement Study (HRS) (see article's text for more details). The file is provided in R data set format (.rds).

3. A .nlogo file with the necesary set up to reproduce the results from the Agent-based model simulations. This includes the working environment with sliders and monitors for the main interface, detailed description of processes and parts along with instructions in the "Information" section and the code to run the simulations.

4. Code to reproduce the Agent-based model simulation using NetLogo. The user is adviced to download the .nlogo file which include the environment already set up with an in-depth description and instructions in the "Information" section. This code is mainly for review purposes.
